# About your resume

<details>
   <summary> Best practices for data science/machine learning/tech resumes </summary>

**Formatting:**  
- Calibri or Didot font
- Size 11-12 for text, 13-14 for headings
- Line-spacing of 1 to 1.15
- Margins of 1 inch on all sides
- .doc is more parseable by Applicant Tracking Softwares
- 1-column resumes are also more parseable

**Header section:**
- Include your correct, most up-to-date contact information. Double-check it.
- Include a link to your LinkedIn and portfolio/GitHub if you have them (you probably should).

**Summary section:** 
- Start with an adjective + job title + years of experience + area of experience (i.e "Resourceful data scientist with 3 years of experience in predictive modeling").
- If you don't have years of experience, describe your goal instead (i.e "Seeking to improve machine learning models at FutureEmployer").
- End with a few of your best achievements (i.e "At PastEmployer, improved forecast accuracy by 34%").
- Try to use less adjectives overall and more numbers (persuading vs convincing a recruiter).

**Experience section:** 
- Put it before education if you have extensive work experience.
- Your most recent experience appears first.
- Use 3-5 bullet points for each job.
- List your responsibilities for each job you had, but more importantly your *achievements* (i.e "improved forecast accuracy by 34%").
- Use precise action verbs like "designed", "optimized", "predicted" instead of "responsible for" and "handled".
- Say precisely what technique(s) you used (i.e "logistic regression model" instead of just "data modeling").
- Numbers ! Numbers ! Numbers ! Try to add numbers to each bullet point. By how many % did you improve accuracy ? 
How much money/time did you save ? How many procedures did you optimize ?

**Education section:**  
- Put it before your work experience if you're a new graduate.
- List relevant awards, clubs, and activities you did in school.
- Mention that you *excelled* in any courses you did great in.
- Mention quality school projects and research papers if you have any.

**Projects section:** (optional)
- If you have any clean, well-documented projects, showcase them.  

**Skills:**
- Include all keywords in the job description that apply to you. This is important for ATS keyword scanning.
- Do *NOT* forget soft skills : use the ones that are in the job description.
   
</details>

**Resources:**
- Upload your resume to a **resume scanner** (like [this](https://www.jobscan.co/) or [this](https://cultivatedculture.com/resume-scanner/)) to check that companies' Applicant Tracking Softwares (ATS) are able to correctly read your resume. 
- Alternatively, LinkedIn has a free Resume Builder feature on your profile that lets you cross-check keywords on your resume with the keywords on the average job posting 
for your chosen job title, as well as automatically create an ATS-friendly resume.  
- If you want to, invest in a resume writing service. They are professionals who know how to write the best possible resume for ATS, but the prices can be a little on 
the expensive side sometimes.
- [JobSeer.ai](https://jobseer.ai/) is a powerful Chrome extension that shows you your match % with any given job posting, as well as recruiter and referral contact info, 
keyword matching, etc.
- The [GHC Resume Database](https://ghc.anitab.org/attend/resume-database) lets 400+ companies access your resume for job and internship opportunities and provides a **free in-depth resume review** service !
- [Techintern.io](https://www.techintern.io/student) is an internship resume database that lets you select every month which companies you are interested in interning at.
